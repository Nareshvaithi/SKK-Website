                <p className="text-lg pt-5">The roots of Saraswathy Kala Kendra (SKK) were planted in 1967 by T Narayanamurthy and Meera Narayan in Perambur, with just three students embracing Bharathanatyam and Carnatic Music. In 1975, SKK took shape, blossoming into an institution with regular classes and a structured annual syllabus. This endeavor bore fruit, benefiting numerous students. From there, SKKâ€™s popularity grew, resonating throughout Perambur and beyond.
