                <p className="text-xl">The roots of Saraswathy Kala Kendra (SKK) were planted in 1967 by T Narayanamurthy and Meera Narayan in Perambur, with just three students embracing Bharathanatyam and Carnatic Music. In 1975, SKK took shape, blossoming into an institution with regular classes and a structured annual syllabus. This endeavor bore fruit, benefiting numerous students. From there, SKKâ€™s popularity grew, resonating throughout Perambur and beyond.

The Government of Tamil Nadu recognized our dedication to the arts and honored us with state recognition in 1981. Meera Narayan's choreographic brilliance shone in productions like Krishna Leela, Dasavatharam, and Padmavathi Kalyanam, earning admiration from all corners. Her daughters, Kiran Mayee and Yagna Prabha, embraced the mantle of teaching at our institution.
